## Extend Typedapi to fit your needs
You ended up in this file if:
 - the default implements for a HTTP framework doesn't fit your needs
 - if the framework you want to use is not supported
 - you need more specilized [RequestDataBuilder](https://github.com/pheymann/typedapi/blob/master/client/src/main/scala/typedapi/client/RequestDataBuilder.scala), [RouteExtractors](https://github.com/pheymann/typedapi/blob/master/server/src/main/scala/typedapi/server/RouteExtractor.scala), [MediaTypes](https://github.com/pheymann/typedapi/blob/update-docs-final-cleanups/shared/src/main/scala/typedapi/shared/ApiElement.scala#L58), or the like

### General remark
I kept most of the type-classes open. That means you can override them as you like. If a certain class like *RequestDataBuilder* doesn't fullfil your needs just add another instance. Take a look at available implementations to get an idea how it works or ask a question in Gitter.

### Write your own Client backend
To write your own client backend you have to implement the [ApiRequest](https://github.com/pheymann/typedapi/blob/master/client/src/main/scala/typedapi/client/ApiRequest.scala) type-classes:
  - `GetRequest`
  - `PutRequest` and `PutWithBodyRequest`
  - `PostRequest` and `PostWithBodyRequest`
  - `DeleteRequest`

Take a look into [http4s-client](https://github.com/pheymann/typedapi/blob/master/http4s-client/src/main/scala/typedapi/client/http4s/package.scala) to get an idea how to do it.

You can implement all type-classes or just a subset to override implementations provided by TypedApi.

### Write your own Server backend
To write your own server backend you have to implement the [EndpointExecutor](https://github.com/pheymann/typedapi/blob/master/server/src/main/scala/typedapi/server/EndpointExecutor.scala) and [MountEndpoints](https://github.com/pheymann/typedapi/blob/master/server/src/main/scala/typedapi/server/ServerManager.scala) type-classes

Take a look into [http4s-server](https://github.com/pheymann/typedapi/blob/master/http4s-server/src/main/scala/typedapi/server/http4s/package.scala) to get an idea how to do it.

You can implement all type-classes or just a subset to override implementations provided by TypedApi.
